<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">oodrow</span> Wilson named the first volume of his <i>History of
the United States</i> "The Swarming of the English." We
might go further and compare the colonization and expansion in
the New World to a fissioning process in which individual atoms
are torn loose from a former pattern of coherence and fused into
new and strange patterns. The United States, indeed, is still in
the process of fusion following the earlier fission process. It has
not yet reached the stability that comes to some nations in history,
and which is marked by a fixed pattern of population growth,
land use, day-to-day habits, and philosophic beliefs. It is, rather,
a country in which every generation can look back to a strangely
different era that existed before it came of age.</p>

<p>The period 1625-1660 in Virginia history is an important one
for the study of the fission-fusion process in America. During
those years Virginia's population increased perhaps twenty-five
or thirty fold, and the settlements spread from a thin belt along
the James River to the whole of Tidewater Virginia. Human
atoms were propelled outwards in every direction in an uncontrolled
and only feebly directed expansion.</p>

<p>The years 1607 to 1625 had created a base for this expansion.
Those had been crucial years and difficult ones. Settlements had
resembled military camps and individual colonists had been commanded
like soldiers. Rigorous administration of justice, fear of
the Indians, and the strict economic regulations imposed by the
London Company had served to restrain the potentially expansive
nature of the colonists.</p>

<p>The year 1625 saw Virginia under a new King and under a
new form of government. The charter of the London Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
was made void, and the colony passed from the control of a commercial
company to the direct control of King Charles I.</p>

<p>The official census of the non-Indian population of Virginia
in 1625 showed 1,232 persons in the colony. Nine hundred and
fifty-two were males, twelve of them Negroes. Two hundred and
eighty were females, eleven of them Negroes. Although the
colony had been in existence for eighteen years the fissioning
process had hardly begun. But it was beginning. Five years later
the population had more than doubled to approximately 3,000.
In 1640 the population jumped to 8,000, and by 1670 to 40,000,
of whom 2,000 were Negroes. Every aspect of Virginia life&mdash;political,
physical, economic, social, and moral&mdash;was to be affected
by this explosive and uncontrolled growth.</p>

<p>Virginia did not develop any cities or even towns during the
period 1625-1660. Indeed, the towns, such as Jamestown and
Henrico, that had earlier been established, declined in population
or were totally abandoned. The immigrants who were funneled
into the colony through Jamestown were soon attracted to
the ever widening frontier. During the first twenty years colonists
had lived in organized farming communities, separated from other
such settlements, but strictly supervised by local "plantation
commanders." The separate settlements were variously called
"colonies," "plantations," "hundreds," and "particular plantations,"
and sometimes contained hundreds of planters. Frequently
the "plantation" was located within a loop of the James River.
The members of the settlement planted their crops within the
loop, and set up palisades and forts at the open end for their
common defense. Sentinels and guards were provided cooperatively
to man the defenses. As the settlers increased in numbers
and the power of their governors and of the Indians to restrain
them decreased, however, they tended to leave the organized
communities and to carve out for themselves individual plantations
in the wilderness. Thus, even while the population of the
colony grew by leaps and bounds, the population of Jamestown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and other areas where population was once concentrated declined.
It was a process, one might call it, of de-urbanization.</p>

<p>What was it that reversed the process of urbanization that was
going on in the mother country? The attraction was, of course,
the land and its fruits. England, with her five or six millions, was
not overpopulated by modern standards. Nor was she overpopulated
by comparison with the great nations of the Orient such
as China which could even in that period count its population in
the hundreds of millions. But her few millions seemed at times
to oppress the English soil. On the other hand, America was a
relatively new home of the human species. Perhaps less than a
million Indians lived within the present bounds of the United
States, and the Indians with whom the English in Virginia came
in contact numbered less than 10,000. "In the beginning all the
world was America," wrote John Locke, and the English townsmen,
villagers, and yeomen who came to America found it natural
to revert back to the time when Adam went forth from the Garden
of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken. It
would be more truthful to say, however, that the English went
not so much in sorrow as in confidence, as the sons of Abraham
to whom God had promised all the land of Canaan for an everlasting
possession.</p>

<p>Tobacco was the richest fruit of the land. Despite the moral
opprobrium in which the "vile, stinking weed" was held by men in
England, including King James himself, the public soon developed
an insatiable appetite for it. Having for the Europeans the
attraction of novelty and utility, it commanded an enormous
price in the early years of the settlement. With Spanish tobacco
selling at eighteen shillings a pound in 1619, the opportunities
for gain from tobacco production seemed unlimited. Here was
the "gold" that Virginia had to offer, and soon all hands could
think of nothing else. The earliest settlers, hoping to emulate the
Spaniards in finding great treasures and living off the labor of
the Indians, had suffered bitterly from shortages of food. Later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
settlers, though they did not hold to the expectations of the first
arrivals, still sought the avenue of quickest and greatest gain,
and tobacco provided that avenue. Throughout the 1620's many
planters neglected to grow corn or wheat, preferring to obtain
their food supply by barter or seizure from the Indians, or by purchase
from planters who were willing to divert their labor to such
crops. Who would bother with grain when tobacco sold for as
much per pound as grain did per bushel? Frenchmen, brought
over to introduce vine-growing in the colony, neglected their specialty
to plant tobacco and had to be restrained by an act of February
1632. An act of February 1633 similarly required all gunsmiths,
brickmakers, carpenters, joiners, sawyers, and turners to
work at their trades and not to plant tobacco or do other work in
the ground.</p>

<p>Another booklet in this series deals with agriculture in Virginia.
It is enough to say here that as the total production of tobacco
increased so did the price decline. Our present-day farm surplus
problem is not new. Even when the price had plummeted to a
penny a pound the planters were not discouraged from planting.
Attempts were made on both sides of the Atlantic to fix prices and
to control the amount of production in order to restore prosperity
to the tobacco farmers. The important questions were whose interests
would be served, and how would they be served best?</p>

<p>The death of James I and the dissolution of the Virginia Company
occurred almost at the same time. Charles I, his son, assumed
the throne in 1625 and promptly assured the planters that
though the form of Virginia's government had changed, the individual
planters could be sure that their rights and property
would be respected. Charles informed the colonists, however,
that he would take over the buying of their tobacco as a royal
monopoly and give them such prices as would satisfy and encourage
them. Agreement with the planters, nevertheless, was
difficult to obtain. The Virginians were solidly united as a special
interest in favoring the highest prices and the greatest pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>duction.
Their representatives, both in the House of Burgesses
and on the Council, were their ardent spokesmen, themselves
planters, whose interest lay in fighting the battle of all Virginians.
On the other hand the King, and the English merchants and
associates through whom he dealt, desired to buy Virginia's tobacco
at the lowest possible prices and in moderate quantities. The
tug of war between the two sides continued for many years without
any clear-cut resolution.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Virginia Under Wyatt and Yeardley, 1625-1627:
Tobacco and Defense</span></div>

<p>Sir Francis Wyatt, who had been the London Company's
Governor in the period 1621-1624, was appointed Governor by
James I the first year the colony was under royal control. Although
the King made no specific provision for the continuation of a representative
Assembly, Wyatt and the Council called together representatives
of the various settlements to meet in a General Assembly
on May 10, 1625, in Jamestown. There they drew up a
petition complaining of the old Company rule and the miserable
state in which it had kept the colony during the previous twelve
years, and pleading with the King not to allow a monopoly of the
tobacco trade. The King's advisers, they feared, were those who
had formerly oppressed them and who would do so again should
the King consent to a "pernitious contract" taking all their tobacco
at unfair rates. To present their case against the contract they
chose Sir George Yeardley, former Governor, to go to England
as their agent. The willingness of Wyatt and the Council to call
such an Assembly and the unanimity of views deriving from it,
show how single in their economic interests all Virginians were.</p>

<p>Governor Wyatt attempted to prevent disorderly expansion of
settlement and to build positions of strength in the colony, but he
knew that the "affection" of the planters to "their privat dividents"
was too strong a force to resist. Hence he recommended that a
palisade be built from Martin's Hundred on the James River to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Chiskiack on the York River, with houses spaced along it at
convenient intervals. In this way the Indians might be kept out
of the entire lower portion of the peninsula, the cattle kept in, and
the colony provided with a secure base for the development of its
economy. After the economy was flourishing, there would be a
chance for finding the riches in the mountains to the west and
the longed-for passage to the South Sea, so confidently believed
to lie just beyond the Appalachians. All these enterprises presupposed
the "winning of the Forest" between the York and the
James, which Wyatt hoped to accomplish by means of his palisade
scheme.</p>

<p>Wyatt's project was not immediately put into effect. In 1626
he was replaced by Sir George Yeardley. Yeardley, like Wyatt,
devoted much of his time to devising means to promote the security
of the colony against attack by land or by sea.</p>

<p>It is hard for us to realize how desperately concerned with their
security were the few thousand Englishmen who inhabited Virginia
at this time. Separated from the mother country by 3,000
miles of ocean, a dangerous crossing usually taking two months,
the settlers had only a precarious toe hold on a vast continent.
From the ocean side the settlers feared possible attack from other
European colonizing powers: the Spanish, French, or Dutch. The
Spanish ambassador in London in the early period of the Virginia
settlement had frequently urged his government to wipe out
the struggling colony. But the indecision of Spain's monarch had
saved the colony.</p>

<p>The Virginians themselves had engaged in expeditions against
the French settled in Maine, and spoke menacingly of the Dutch
who had established a settlement on the King's domain in Hudson's
River in 1613. The claims of the European monarchs to the
American continent conflicted with one another, and there seemed
little chance that a resolution would come by any other means
than war. So it proved to be, later. In the meantime, at home,
Virginia settlers stood on guard. Governor Yeardley appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Capt. William Tucker, one of the Virginia Council, to check at
Point Comfort all ships entering the James River. Tucker was
provided with a well-armed shallop and absolute authority to
check all ships arriving. He could not do battle with an enemy
warship, of course, but he could give the alarm in case the enemy
appeared. A few years later a fort was built at Point Comfort to
defend the entrance to Virginia's great river. Although the channel
was too wide ever to be adequately commanded by the cannon
of the day, the fort provided some protection to the colony.</p>

<p>Yeardley made similar efforts to strengthen Virginia's position
on land against the numerically superior Indians. Like Wyatt he
urged the necessity of "planting the forest" rather than jumping
beyond it to areas far from existing settlements. As a means of
controlling the population Yeardley issued a proclamation requiring
that anyone who desired to move his place of residence within
the colony must obtain prior permission from the Governor and
Council. Even to be absent for a short time from his place of
residence, a planter was required to get permission from his
"plantation commander." As was pointed out earlier, "plantations"
in this early period were usually not the individually-owned,
individually-operated plantations of later times, but "private
colonies" or "particular plantations," organized on a joint-stock
basis, on which more than a hundred men might live.</p>

<p>In keeping with his conception of the colony as a military
outpost, Yeardley made plans for an armed settlement on the York
at Chiskiack, and devised a project for a surprise attack on all
the surrounding Indians on the first day of August 1627. Each
"particular plantation" was to march against an Indian town, kill
as many Indians as possible, and seize or cut down what corn it
could. The attack was a success, but because of a scarcity of shot
the English failed in their desired goal of utterly extirpating the
red men.</p>

<p>In November 1627 Yeardley died, and the Council chose one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of its number, Captain Francis West, to assume the role of Governor
and Captain General.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Virginia Under Francis West and Dr. John Pott, 1627-1630</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile the King had grown increasingly disgusted that
Virginia's economy continued to be "built on smoke," and he ordered
the Virginians to concentrate on crops and products other
than tobacco. Among the products urged on the colonists were
iron, salt, pitch and tar, potash, and pipe staves. As his directives
went unheeded, the King determined to force a drastic reduction
in the planting of the profitable tobacco crop. In instructions
sent out in 1627 he directed that no master of a family be allowed
to plant above 200 pounds of tobacco and no servant more
than 125 pounds. He also ordered that all tobacco was to be consigned
to him or his representatives.</p>

<p>Charles directed that a general assembly of the planters' representatives
be summoned to deal with his proposals, and Governor
West and the Council ordered an Assembly to meet on
March 10, 1628. The Assembly thanked the King for prohibiting
the importation of Spanish tobacco into the English market, but
cried that they would be at the mercy of covetous individuals
in England if a monopoly on Virginia tobacco was allowed. They
proposed, however, that since the King intended to take all
their tobacco, he should agree to take at least 500,000 pounds of
tobacco at 3 shillings 6 pence the pound delivered in Virginia,
or 4 shillings delivered in London. If the King was unwilling
to take so much, they desired the right to export again from
England to the Low Countries, Ireland, Turkey, and elsewhere.
As to the King's proposal to limit tobacco cultivation to 200
pounds for the master of a family and 125 pounds for a servant,
"every weake judgment," they asserted, could see that this would
not be sufficient for their maintenance. As to the King's desire
that the colonists should produce pitch and tar, pipe staves, and
iron, they complained that much capital was needed to put such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>enterprises in operation. Few planters either could or would undertake
such schemes when tobacco culture required so little
capital and produced such quick and profitable results.</p>

<p>The Assembly commissioned Sir Francis Wyatt, then in England,
and two Virginians to represent them in negotiations with
the King. They were to be allowed to come down six pence on
each of the figures insisted upon by Governor, Council, and
Burgesses in their answer to the King's letter.</p>

<p>As in 1625, the opportunity to join in Assembly for the purpose
of agreeing on regulations for tobacco production allowed the
planters to deal with other matters. Wesley Frank Craven has
written that "representative government in America owes much
in its origins to an attempt to win men's support of a common
economic program by means of mutual consent." Had the King
been less desirous of taking every planter's tobacco and less concerned
with the neglect of staple commodities, he might well
have governed the colony without calling the planters together
in periodic "assemblies."</p>

<p>Dr. John Pott was elected by the Council on March 5, 1629,
to succeed West as Governor, and he governed in Virginia for
one year. Few men possess a less savory record than this first
representative of the medical profession in America. In 1624
he had been ordered removed from the Virginia Council, at the
insistence of the Earl of Warwick, for his part in the attempt
to poison the colony's Indian foes. He was later convicted of
cattle stealing but spared punishment because he was the only
doctor in the colony and therefore in great demand.</p>

<p>Both West and Pott were foes of the Indians, and in numerous
orders and proclamations denounced former treaties of peace
with them, and directed that perpetual enmity and wars be
maintained against them. A pretended peace was, however, authorized
to be extended to the Indians in August 1628 until certain
captive Englishmen were redeemed; then it was to be broken.</p>

<p>The colonists, too, suffered during the administrations of West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and Pott. One man expressed the hope for "an Easterly wind to
blow to send in Noble Capt. Harvey, And then I shall have wright
for all my wrong." Capt. John Harvey was known in the colony
for the investigation he had conducted in Virginia in 1624-1625,
and the King had appointed him Governor on March 26, 1628.
Harvey did not actually take up his government in Virginia until
two years later. In the meantime West and Pott administered
the colony.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Virginia Under John Harvey, 1630-1632: Expansion
and Development</span></div>

<p>When Harvey arrived in 1630 he found that inadequate restrictions
placed on tobacco production in the previous years had
created an enormous surplus which had forced the price down
to a penny a pound. Harvey found also that because of their
"greedie desires to make store of Tobackoe," the settlers had neglected
to plant sufficient corn, let alone to develop different commodities
as instructed by the King. Calling an Assembly, he convinced
the representatives to agree to reduce the amount of tobacco
planted, and to increase the amount of corn. He also sent ships
into the Chesapeake and southward to Cape Fear to trade for
corn with the Indians to make up the deficit left by the negligent
planters. But most important of all, Harvey put into effect the
long-dreamed-of plan to secure the entire area between the James
and the York by building a palisade between Archer's Hope
Creek (now College Creek), emptying into the James River,
and Queen's Creek, emptying into the York River. Harvey's
plan called also for a settlement on the south side of the York.
This outpost would serve as an advance base and point of defense
for operations against Opechancanough, King of the Pamunkeys,
and his many warriors. Six hundred acres apiece were granted
there in 1630 to Capt. John West, brother of Lord Delaware,
and to Capt. John Utie, who were made commanders of the settlement.
Fifty acres were offered to any person who would settle
there during the first year of its existence and twenty-five during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>the next year. Exactly when the first settlers moved to the York is
uncertain, but it was probably in 1631. West and Utie settled
on either side of a bay formed by the joining of King's Creek and
Felgate's Creek about four miles above modern Yorktown. The
tourist who speeds along the Colonial Parkway from Jamestown
to Yorktown crosses the bay within sight of the tracts granted
West and Utie. Today he may drive from Jamestown to the York
with comfort and safety in a few minutes. It took the early settlers
twenty-four years to cover the same distance.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<a href="images/i011_full.jpg"><img src="images/i011.jpg" width="570" height="311" alt="Map 1" title="" /></a>
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>About the same time, probably in 1630, another distant settlement
was established. William Claiborne, Secretary of the Council
of State of Virginia, with one hundred men, settled Kent
Island 150 miles up Chesapeake Bay. In the Assembly of February
1632 both "Kiskyacke and the Isle of Kent" were represented
by Capt. Nicholas Martiau, ancestor of George Washington.</p>

<p>The great expansion had now begun. Settlers crossed from
the James to the York, and provision was made by an act of the
Assembly of February 1633 for building houses at Middle
Plantation, situated strategically between College Creek and
Queen's Creek, and for "securing" the tract of land lying between
the two creeks.</p>

<p>Besides being concerned with questions of defense, Harvey
pursued a policy of encouraging trade with other colonies in the
New World. Numerous commissions were issued by the Governor
in March and April of 1632 authorizing individuals to
trade with New England, Nova Scotia, and the Dutch plantation
in Hudson's River, as well as with the West Indies. Harvey
even gave instructions to Nathaniel Basse, one of the traders
and a member of the Council, to encourage people from the
other colonies to come to Virginia. "If those of Newe England
shall dislike the coldnes of there clymate or the barrenness of
the soyle," wrote Harvey, "you may propose unto them the
plantinge of Delaware bay, where they shall have what further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>ance
wee cann afford them, and noe impediment objected against
theire owne orders and lawes."</p>

<p>But all was not well in the government of the colony. Harvey
found the Council members constantly opposing him, disputing
his authority, resisting his attempts to administer equal justice
to all men. The royal Governor was not supreme as we now
sometimes mistakenly assume. He was first among equals only.
Decisions at this time were made by majority vote, and the Governor
was frequently outvoted. Moreover the Councilors, who
could devote more of their time to their private affairs, tended
to be better off financially than the Governor himself, who found
it next to impossible to get his salary from the King, and who
was forced to entertain at his own expense all who came to James
City. Harvey complained that he should be called the "host"
rather than the "Governor" of Virginia. In contrast, Samuel
Mathews, one of Harvey's enemies on the Council, owned the
finest estate in Virginia. William Claiborne, another of Harvey's
enemies on the Council, besides a large estate, had a royal commission
and English backers for his powerful trading company.</p>

<p>Harvey made every effort to reconcile the differences which
arose between him and the Council members, and on December
20, 1631, all signed an agreement promising to work in harmony
and to mend their discontent.</p>

<p>Fortified by this agreement, Harvey went forward with his
efforts to put Virginia's agricultural economy on a sound basis.
The principal problem was to force the planters to diversify.
Many tears are shed for the poverty of the planters of Virginia,
and their customary indebtedness to English creditors is usually
cited as proof of their poverty. But this "poverty" was not based
on the inability of the planter to raise enough food to support
himself and his family, but on the fluctuations of the market
price of the crop&mdash;tobacco&mdash;to which he had devoted most of his
energies as a speculative venture. Strange as it may seem, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
planter had to be forced to raise enough food for his own support,
so avid was his desire for quick tobacco profits.</p>

<p>Governor Harvey's Assembly of February 1632 directed that
every man working in the ground should plant and tend at least
two acres of corn per head, on penalty of forfeiture of his entire
crop of tobacco. Harvey hoped to make Virginia "the granarie
to his Majesty's Empire," as Sicily had been to Rome. Another
act allowed corn to be sold for as high a price as could be obtained,
contrary to the usual European and colonial habit of fixing prices
on basic commodities used by the people. The reason given for
this freedom from price fixing was that the precedents of other
countries did not apply to America, "for none are so poore heere,
as that they may not have as much corne, as they will plant,
havinge land enough."</p>

<p>The Assembly of 1632 did, however, fix a price on tobacco,
requiring that it not be sold at less than six pence per pound, a
law they went to great pains to justify to the King. Tobacco was
Virginia's primary economic interest, and the Virginians were
willing to go to any lengths to advance that interest. They urged
the King not to place any impediment to their "free trade," or
right to sell their tobacco wherever they could, and mentioned
that they had already constructed several barques and had begun
trading with the Dutch plantation on Hudson's River. Governor
Harvey asked why the English merchants could not afford to
allow them a penny a pound for their tobacco when the Dutch
paid eighteen pence per pound.</p>

<p>The English merchants who traded with Virginia formed a
tight little group which used its favored position to charge excessive
prices for English-made goods, and to give abnormally low
prices for Virginia tobacco. Such a policy was not entirely owing
to covetousness. The English economy was shackled by a conception
of economic life which believed in the necessity of
monopolies and restrictive devices of all sorts. The Dutch nation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
on the other hand, had thrown off many of the traditional
mercantilist restraints on trade. Holland soon enjoyed a level
of prosperity that made her the envy of the rest of Europe. Her
rivals attributed Dutch success to the energy of her people. "Go
to beat the Dutch" became a byword which has persisted to
this day. Not until a century later did the English realize that
Dutch prosperity was caused not so much by hard work as by
the policy of freeing trade from unnecessary restraints. As Dutch
prosperity increased, Dutch ships appeared in every sea, underselling
all rivals and paying better prices for local products. The
complaint that the London merchants allowed only one penny
a pound for the Virginians' tobacco while the Dutch gave eighteen
strikingly illustrates the measure of Dutch commercial superiority.
No wonder that the London merchants should demand
that the Dutch be excluded from the Virginia market! For the
same reason Virginians, whether Governors, Councilors, Burgesses,
or planters, were, throughout the seventeenth century,
almost unanimously opposed to the English government's policy
of restricting trade with Virginia to English ships and confining
that trade to English ports.</p>

<p>Although Governor Harvey supported the Burgesses and Council
in their strong defense of tobacco production, he privately
wrote that he had not only endeavored to have reduced the
amount of tobacco planted "but if it might have been, to have
utterly rooted out this stinking commodity." He reported that
only the powerful hand of the King and his Council could, however,
effect such an end, so "indeared" were the planters to the
traffic. Moreover, Harvey admitted that until some more staple
commodity could be developed, tobacco could not be prohibited
without the utter ruin of the colony. Virginia was rooted to
tobacco&mdash;seemingly for ever.</p>

<p>The Virginia planters' proposals, of course, met the opposition
of the London merchants, who complained to their powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
friends and associates in the government and urged the King and
his Council to nullify the restrictions which the Virginians tried
to place on the sale of their tobacco. The merchants were particularly
opposed to the desire of the Virginians to by-pass them
and trade with foreign nations directly.</p>

<p>It is hard for us to realize today the immense importance of
merchants and traders in influencing the colonial policies of the
English government. Virginia was founded by a commercial
company. All the early attempts at settlement were made by
private persons who were willing to "adventure" their capital or
their skill. Behind the great explorers stood private individuals
who risked their money on the success of the voyage or settlement.
The "government"&mdash;perhaps it would be truer to say the
Kings and their advisers&mdash;did not have the funds or the foresight
to support these ventures. They were perfectly willing to sign
papers granting lands they did not own to those who were willing
to attempt the settlement, but they were reluctant to put up
their own money except on a sure thing.</p>

<p>Once the settlements were functioning, once revenues were
patently obvious, the monarchs showed more concern with their
government. Merchants still, however, continued to provide the
link between the King and colony to a great extent. In an age
of state regulation and monopolies, in an age which did not
provide fixed salaries for men in high position, there was a close
relationship between the Exchange and the Court. A merchant
dealing with overseas trade could not be successful unless he
had influence at Court. Even after the King took away the
charter of the Virginia Company, merchants continued to apply
pressure to the committees and commissions set up to advise the
King on colonial policy. Although the colonists feared that
Charles I might reinstitute a company over them, and the former
representatives of the Virginia Company pressed for such a move,
the merchants were not able to re-establish direct control over
the colony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Virginia Under Harvey, 1632-1634: Prosperity And
Decentralization</span></div>

<p>In September 1632, under Governor Harvey's direction, the
first revisal of Virginia's laws was made. Twenty-five years of
experience under varying forms of government lay behind the
revisal. All previous laws were examined and brought into conformity
with existing conditions. Most of the legislation concerned
the Church, tobacco, and the Indians, good indications
of what most concerned the early settlers. Highways were also
authorized to be laid out in convenient places, the first sign that
settlement was spreading from the rivers&mdash;the traditional highways
of Virginia&mdash;into the interior. Virginia was becoming more
than a military outpost. It was becoming a "home."</p>

<p>The success of Harvey's attempt to stabilize and diversify
agricultural production is confirmed in the account of Captain
Thomas Young of his voyage to Virginia and Delaware Bay in
1634. Sailing up the James River he noticed that "the cuntry
aboundeth with very great plentie of milk, cheese, butter and
corne, which latter almost every planter in the country hath."
The grim threat of starvation that had in former times hung
over the colony had been dispelled. Although there had been a
rapid increase in population, the food supply more than kept
up with the increase, and thousands of bushels of corn were
even transported and sold to the New England colonists.</p>

<p>The year 1634 also marked the establishment of the county
form of local government in Virginia. The scattered plantations
and settlements, rapidly expanding and hence more difficult to
govern from James City, were now organized into eight counties.
For each a monthly court was established by commission from
the Governor and Council. Provision for separate courts in
outlying areas had been made as early as 1618. Now the shift to
decentralized government was formalized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">The "Thrusting Out" of Governor Harvey and Its
Aftermath, 1635-1641</span></div>

<p>In 1635, in one of the most famous incidents in Virginia's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
early history, Governor Harvey was deposed by his Council.
Many historians have assumed that Harvey was deposed by a
spontaneous uprising of the people no longer able to bear his
oppressive government. There is, however, little justification for
this view. Many more accusations have been hurled at Harvey
by later historians than by his contemporaries, and it is undoubtedly
Harvey's position as a royal Governor and his quick
temper that have caused historians to take such a hostile view
of him. Ever since the successful American Revolution of 1776,
American historians, in interpreting the events of the colonial
period, have jumped at any evidence of discontent as an anticipation
of, and justification for, the War for Independence. They
have not stopped to determine whether the charges hurled at the
royal Governors were true or not. It is enough that someone
accused them of oppression.</p>

<p>The causes of the revolt against Harvey were various. Of first
importance was the continual opposition that existed between
the Governor and his Council. The revolt was not primarily a
revolt of the people but a revolt by certain members of the
Council who attempted to give their particular insubordination
the appearance of a general rebellion.</p>

<p>Harvey's commission was such that he could do nothing except
by majority vote of himself and the Council sitting as a
single body. The Council frequently outvoted him, effectively
blocking his proposals. Harvey bitterly disputed the Council's
power to thwart his will. He pointed out that the King had sent
him to Virginia not only as the new Governor but with the
specific duty of correcting the abuses that were reported to have
existed under previous Governors, especially those abuses for
which members of the Council were responsible. Previous to
his arrival the government had been in the hands of Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
West and Dr. John Pott, elected to office by the other members
of the Council. Pott, whose reputation has been mentioned
earlier, was not pleased to be brought to justice for his dishonest
actions. Nor was Samuel Mathews, an important member of
the Council, pleased to be brought to justice for withholding
the cattle and property of other men. (Mathews, the richest man
in the colony, successfully resisted all legal attempts to divest
him of this property.) Nor were the Council members pleased
when, in accordance with His Majesty's commands, Harvey attempted
to punish those responsible for the ill treatment of
William Capps, sent earlier by the King to start production of
tar, potash, salt, pipe staves and other commodities. The Council
had discouraged him from his mission, except in so far as it
concerned the production of salt, and Pott had issued an order
preventing him from leaving the colony to report to the King.</p>

<p>Another cause for grievance against Harvey was the peace he
made with the local Indians. The colonists distrusted the Indians
more than they distrusted other Europeans. The great massacre
of 1622, when the Indians made a desperate attempt to destroy
the English settlement, had placed Indian-white relations on a
basis of perpetual enmity. Legally, the Indians had never been
considered to have the same rights as the English. English law
throughout the seventeenth century maintained the doctrine that
between Christians and infidels there could exist nothing but
perpetual enmity, a view which was a hangover from the period
of the Crusades, wars against the Turks, and expansion by
militant Christian nations into heathen lands during the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries. It is true that practical co-operation and
on-the-spot recognition of Indian rights had developed in Virginia
in the early years. The massacre of 1622, however, gave
Virginians an excuse for abandoning all forms of co-operation
with, and respect for, the Indians. Deceit and breach of faith
were elevated into acknowledged instruments of policy. The right
of the Indians even to occupy the land of their forefathers was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
denied. They were admitted to exist and to hold land <i>in fact</i>,
but the English refused to recognize <i>in law</i> either their existence
or their title to land. Total extirpation was resolved against those
Indian nations which had taken part in the massacre. "Marches"
were periodically ordered against the various tribes with the
purpose of destroying or seizing their corn, burning their shelters,
and killing as many members of the tribe as possible.</p>

<p>Governor Harvey reversed this policy and made peace with
the Indians against the advice of Dr. Pott and other Councilors.
He also attempted to see that some measure of equity was extended
to Indian-white relations. As a result, the more aggressive
planters accused him of promoting a second massacre.</p>

<p>What really set off the revolt against Harvey, however, was
the injection of the hottest issue of the day into the controversy:
whether Harvey was "soft" on Catholicism. This issue was
brought to a head because of the grant of a portion of Virginia's
original territory to George Calvert, first Lord Baltimore. Harvey
had extended a helping hand to Baltimore's colonists. Although
his actions in this regard were specifically required of him by
the King, and although he received especially warm commendation
from the English government for doing so, the Virginia
colonists objected. The King's grant, for one thing, had been
carved out of the Virginia Company's old bounds which had
been left undisturbed when the Company lost its right to govern
the area. Already Virginians were beginning to eye the benefits
of settlement in the northern reaches of Chesapeake Bay. One,
Colonel William Claiborne, Secretary of the colony, had obtained
a royal commission to trade in the area and had established a
settlement on Kent Island, opposite the present Annapolis, far
up Chesapeake Bay. By acting on the King's instructions and
supporting Baltimore's authority in the area against Claiborne's
claims, Harvey turned the second most important man in the
colony against him.</p>

<p>Harvey at first backed the Virginia Council's assertion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Kent Island was a part of Virginia, and not part of the supposedly
uncultivated wilderness granted to Baltimore by the King. But in
the face of Charles's obvious desire to take the area away from
Virginia, and because Claiborne's patent authorized trade rather
than settlement, Harvey soon accepted Lord Baltimore's position
that Claiborne's trading post lay within the limits of Baltimore's
jurisdiction. Irritation between the two men increased when
Harvey attempted jointly with the Maryland authorities to conduct
an examination of charges that Claiborne was stirring up
Maryland's Indians against the new settlers. Claiborne was accused
of telling the local Indians that the new settlers were not
Englishmen but Spaniards. The investigation which ensued was
hampered at every turn by Claiborne and his friends on the Virginia
Council.</p>

<p>The Virginians were most concerned not by the apparent violation
of Virginia's territorial integrity, but by the fact that the
new settlement was being established and settled by Roman Catholics.
The Virginians were less tolerant than the King in wishing
success to Lord Baltimore, a Catholic, and his fellow religionists,
in establishing a colony on their northern border. The Virginia
Council wrote Charles in 1629 thanking him for "the freedome
of our Religion which wee have enjoyed," and asserting proudly
that "noe papists have beene suffered to settle amongst us." They
insisted upon tendering the oaths of supremacy and allegiance
to Lord Baltimore when he arrived in Virginia in October 1629
to consider a possible settlement, and reported to the King that
he had refused to take those oaths. Charles I had married a
Catholic, Henrietta Maria of France, and, like his father, James
I, was not disposed to allow too rigorous penalties against those
who professed religious allegiance to Rome. But the Parliament,
and the people in general, feared and hated Catholics, believing
their religious beliefs to be incompatible with loyalty to a Protestant
state.</p>

<p>By means of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy Catholics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
were required to recognize the English sovereign as their rightful
ruler in matters spiritual and ecclesiastical as well as temporal,
to repudiate the papal claim to depose heretical princes,
to promise to fight for the King in case of rebellion caused by a
papal sentence of deposition, and to denounce the doctrine that
princes, being excommunicated, could be deposed or murdered,
or that subjects could be absolved from their oath of allegiance.
The oaths were based on a real fear which identified Roman Catholicism
with treason. Protestants felt that Catholics owed their
highest allegiance to a foreign power, and hence were not good
Englishmen. The problem was a complicated one, and much debated
at the time and since. Now it is generally accepted that
one can owe spiritual allegiance to Rome while remaining a
faithful subject of a non-Catholic state. In England in the seventeenth
century, however, the Church of Rome was too closely
identified with England's mortal enemies to allow her freely to
tolerate Catholics in her midst. For a long period England had
feared Spain as the greatest threat to her existence. Even after
the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 this fear persisted and
to a certain extent was transferred to France, another Catholic
power. The measures taken against the Catholics in England
were similar to those taken against Communists in this country
today, and they were taken for the same reason: the fear that
the followers of a universal ideology would turn against their
local allegiance if the two ever came in conflict.</p>

<p>Eventually Charles's easy attitude towards Catholics helped
bring about his downfall. In a similar way Harvey's compliance
with the King's instructions to aid and respect Baltimore's colonists
weakened his popularity in Virginia.</p>

<p>As the locus of power in England shifted from the King and
his lords towards the Parliament and the people, a stronger
Protestant and democratic policy became necessary. The eventual
result of this shift in power became evident with the beheading
of Charles I in 1649 and, later, with the Glorious Revolution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
1689 and the crowning of William and Mary as constitutional
symbols of the power of the English nation.</p>

<p>So great was the popular feeling in Virginia against the "Papists"
in Maryland that many, in casual conversation, exclaimed
that they would rather knock their cattle on the head than sell
them to Maryland. To accommodate the needs of the new settlers
in Maryland, Harvey sent them some cows of his own and did
his best to ease their early struggles, in accordance with the King's
commands. He could not do all he wished, however, because he
was frequently outvoted at the Council meetings on anything
that had to do with Maryland.</p>

<p>The deposition of Governor Harvey had its origin on April 27,
1635, in a mutinous gathering held in the York River area, Virginia's
first frontier settlement outside the James River. The ring-leader
seems to have been Francis Pott, brother of Doctor Pott,
who harangued the meeting about the alleged injustice of Governor
Harvey, and about the Governor's toleration for Indians,
which he said would bring on another massacre. Francis Pott had
formerly been commander of the fort at Point Comfort but had
a short time before been discharged by Harvey for misbehavior.</p>

<p>Harvey ordered the principals in the York meeting arrested,
and called the Council together to consider what action should
be taken against them. The Council opposed Harvey's desire
to proceed against them by martial law, and began to excuse
the dissidents on the grounds of the many complaints the people
had about the government. Harvey thereupon demanded
opinions in writing on what should be done with the mutineers.
George Menefie, the first Councilor of whom Harvey demanded
such a written statement, said he was but a young lawyer and
dared not give a sudden opinion. A violent debate ensued. The
rest of the Council also refused to put their opinions in writing.
At the next meeting of the Council, Menefie began to recount
the grievances of the country, naming Harvey's detention of the
Assembly's letter to the King as the principal one. The original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of this letter, refusing the King's propositions concerning a tobacco
contract, Harvey had retained, as likely to infuriate the
monarch and do the country no good. Instead he had sent a copy
of the letter to the Secretary of State. At Menefie's words, Harvey,
in a rage, brought his hand down sharply on the Councilor's
shoulder and said, "Do you say so? I arrest you on suspicion of
treason to his Majesty." Then Capt. John Utie and Capt. Samuel
Mathews seized Harvey and said, "And we you upon suspicion
of treason to his Majesty." Secretary Richard Kemp immediately
stepped between the men and told Utie and Mathews
that Harvey was the King's Lieutenant and that they had done
more than they could answer for. Mathews and Utie released
their hold on the Governor but demanded that he go to England
to answer the people's complaints. To emphasize their demand
Dr. John Pott signaled forty soldiers who had been concealed
outside the Governor's house (where the meeting was held) to
march up to the door, apparently as a form of threat, although
the mutineers protested that the guard was for the Governor's
safety. More days of negotiations passed. The rebellious Council
called an Assembly to hear charges against Harvey, and chose
Capt. John West to be Governor until His Majesty's pleasure
might be known. Finally Harvey agreed to return to England.
Francis Pott went on the same ship home.</p>

<p>In England the Privy Council heard the charges against Harvey
and his defense. None of the accusations stood up, and he
was able to show why the Council had private reasons to desire
his removal. The King directed him to return to his government
with increased power, and ordered the Councilors who had been
instrumental in deposing him to be sent to England for trial.
Harvey was able to collect some of his back pay and to obtain the
King's agreement that he should return in a ship of war. Unfortunately,
an old and unseaworthy prize ship was provided him
which had to turn back shortly after its departure, and Harvey
was forced to take passage on an ordinary merchant ship which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
arrived in Virginia January 18, 1637. Harvey suffered great
losses because of the unseaworthiness of the prize ship, and petitioned
the King for recompense. He was, however, ordered to
pay out of his own pocket all the losses he had sustained by the
affair, although he was authorized to collect an equivalent amount
from the estates of the mutinous Councilors should they be convicted.</p>

<p>The sending of the mutinous Councilors&mdash;Capt. John West,
Samuel Mathews, John Utie, and William Pierce&mdash;as prisoners
to England, strangely enough allowed them to accomplish what
they had been unable to do in Virginia. So many and so powerful
were their friends, so wealthy were they themselves, and so
many were the charges that they contrived against Harvey now
that he was back in the colony and unable to answer them,
that the King soon reversed himself and ordered Harvey relieved
of his post. The King's action illustrates one of the little appreciated
factors in American colonial history: the role played
by petitions to the King. Three thousand miles of ocean, and
months, even years, in time, separated the assertion from the
proof, encouraged the most exaggerated charges, and contributed
to the unjustified sympathy extended by the King to many petitioners
who did not deserve such consideration. Some of the
"crimes" charged against Harvey were even discovered to have
their origin in the King's own commands or in earlier acts of
Assembly. Yet they contributed to clouding the atmosphere and
blinding the lords of England to the true worth of their representative
in Virginia.</p>

<p>On the basis of unjustified or unsupported charges concerning
Harvey's alleged misappropriation of the mutinous Councilors'
estates, which had been seized for the King pending their trial,
the King, on May 25, 1637, ordered these estates returned to their
owners. Harvey complied immediately as far as four of the Councilors
were concerned, but he had already allowed legal action
to be directed against Mathews' estate by those who had claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
against Mathews, and judgments had been made in favor of the
plaintiffs. When the English government heard he had not turned
back Mathews' property, it promptly ordered that he do so without
delay, which order Harvey then tried to put into effect as
best he could. The damage had been done, however, and the impression
created that he had willfully misappropriated Mathews'
property and disobeyed the King's commands.</p>

<p>Harvey's fight against the charges his enemies brought against
him in England suffered another blow when Mr. Anthony
Panton, a minister who had been twice banished from the colony,
returned to England to add his complaints to those of the others.
Harvey was not given a chance to defend himself against the new
charges, and on January 11, 1639, Sir Francis Wyatt was appointed
to succeed him.</p>

<p>On Wyatt's arrival Harvey's estate was seized and the old Governor
prevented from returning to England until he could satisfy
his creditors. To meet their demands, Harvey, in 1640, was forced
to sell all his land and much of his personal property. The fact
that he was in debt to many persons in the colony is itself a significant
indication that he had not abused the powers of his office.
It is a curious fact that both Governor Sir William Berkeley
and Governor Harvey were much in debt when the rebellions
against their rule began, while their principal enemies were among
the wealthiest men in the colony.</p>

<p>Harvey was finally able to return to England, probably in 1641.
There he found Anthony Panton continuing his campaign of
defamation against him. Panton was not content to accuse the
previous government in Virginia of every sort of general crime
(although he failed to cite any specific instance of oppression)
but charged that the commission the King had granted to Sir
William Berkeley in August 1641 to replace Wyatt had been
surreptitiously obtained. The House of Lords therefore ordered
Berkeley's voyage delayed while they examined the case. The
House of Commons, on the basis of an earlier petition from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Panton, had similarly prevented the return to Virginia of Richard
Kemp, Secretary of the colony, and Christopher Wormeley. Both
Berkeley and the two Virginians presented counterpetitions, the
one pointing out that he was charged with nothing and hence
desired not to be held up on his costly voyage, the others asserting
that all Panton's accusations were untrue and similarly requesting
permission to leave. The House of Lords thereupon
granted these petitions, sending Panton's charges to the Governor
and Council of Virginia for a decision.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">The Early Administration of Sir William Berkeley,
1642-1644: an Era of Good Feeling</span></div>

<p>In March 1642 Sir William Berkeley took up his duties in
Virginia and began a career which ended both gloriously and
ignominiously thirty-five years later. Berkeley came from a distinguished
family, was a graduate of Oxford and the Inns of
Court, a playwright, and a courtier much admired by the King.
Men frequently wondered why he chose to waste his talents in
the American wilderness when he might have achieved eminence
at Court. The mystery will probably ever remain. In Virginia
Berkeley had to work with many of the same Councilors who bedeviled
Harvey, but Berkeley was able to get along well with
them and with the Assembly and people of Virginia. No Governor
of Virginia in the seventeenth century was ever so well or
so deservedly loved by the people. Since he ended his long career
as Governor amidst a colonial rebellion against his rule in 1676,
historians have found it hard to determine whether to bestow
praise or blame upon him. Usually he is praised for his early
years in the government and condemned for his later years, thus
taking on a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character. The last word
has not yet been written on Governor Berkeley, however, and his
character may prove to be more consistent than historians have
realized.</p>

<p>Berkeley's first action was to join the Burgesses and Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in a violent denunciation of those who were attempting to reinstitute
the old Virginia Company's control over the colony. In a
"Declaration against the Company" Berkeley and the Assembly
asserted that government under the Company had been intolerable
and if introduced again would destroy all the democratic rights
allowed by the King's instructions, such as legal trial by jury,
the right to petition the King, and yearly Assemblies. The readmission
of the Company would also, the declaration asserted, impeach
the "freedom of our trade (which is the blood and life of a
commonwealth)." The declaration went on to order that anyone
who promoted the restoration of the Company's power would,
upon due conviction, be held an enemy to the colony and forfeit
his whole estate.</p>

<p>Berkeley's next action was to recommend the repeal of the tax
of four pounds of tobacco per poll which formerly had been levied
for the Governor's use. The Assembly acknowledged this as "a
benefit descending unto us and our posterity ... contributed to
us by our present Governor." Berkeley abolished certain other
valuable emoluments due him by virtue of his office "wherein,"
the Assembly declared, "we may not likewise silence the bounty
of our present Governor in preferring the public freedom before
his particular profit." Finally Berkeley recommended that taxes
be proportioned in some measure "according to mens abilities and
estates" rather than by the old poll tax system, and the new
scheme was, for a brief period, put into effect.</p>

<p>Governor Berkeley not only showed himself selfless in restraining
his own opportunities for profit, but fearless in restraining the
colonists' itch for land. A few months before his arrival, the Assembly
had authorized settlement both on the north side of the
York and in the Rappahannock area, if it could be done in great
enough force. Opechancanough was to be offered fifty barrels of
corn a year for the area between the York and the Piankatank, although
the English proposed to take the area whether Opechancanough
accepted the offer or not. Twenty-four years had elapsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
before English settlement jumped from the James to the York.
Now, ten years after the first settlements on the York, Virginians
were settling on the next great river to the north, the Rappahannock.
By the time Berkeley arrived, some settlers had established
themselves in the area, and many more had claimed grants. Indian
hostility was great, however, and soon a number of the settlers
returned to more secure areas of the country.</p>

<p>Berkeley, working with the Assembly of March 1643, obtained
a law which provided that the Rappahannock River region
should remain "unseated," though grants might be tentatively
claimed in the area, until the Governor, Council, and Burgesses,
that is, the Grand Assembly, should authorize settlement there.
The Governor was attempting to regulate the expansion of the
colony so that the twin goals of security for the English and justice
for the Indians could both be secured. In this he was not
entirely successful, since he could only guide, not arbitrarily direct,
the representatives of the people. The rich, virgin land of
the frontier exerted a continuing attraction to the tobacco planters,
and five years later, in 1648, the restrictions on settlement
in the Rappahannock region, as well as in the Potomac region,
were officially lifted.</p>

<p>Many other important policy decisions were made at the March
1643 meeting of the Grand Assembly. One of these decisions
concerned church government. The first act provided for the
establishment of church government according to the Anglican
form. Virginia was not formed as a protest against the Church
of England, as were the Puritan colonies in New England in large
measure. Conformity in religious matters was considered a virtue
in Virginia. The Assembly, indeed, enacted that nonconformist
ministers be compelled to depart the colony, an act which did
much to sour Virginia's relations with New England. What was
significant about the act, however, was that, with certain exceptions
and qualifications, it gave the vestry of every parish power
to elect the minister of the parish. Because established landlords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and nobles did not exist to build and endow churches as in England,
the representatives of the people, in the vestry, had to assume
the role of patron, to build the church, and to provide for
the support of the minister. In such circumstances it was natural
that much of the power that remained in the hierarchy of church,
state, and society in England should, in Virginia, pass to the
ordinary people and be exercised through their representatives&mdash;the
vestry and Burgesses. The people, not the King, became the
patron of the Church of England in Virginia. Popular responsibility
replaced clerical responsibility and added one more phase
of life to those controlled directly by the people in the New
World. It is significant that Patrick Henry, years before the Revolution,
should first have asserted the doctrine of popular responsibility
and authority in a case&mdash;the celebrated "Parsons' Cause"&mdash;involving
the people's authority over the church.</p>

<p>An even more significant indication of the shift in power in
the government was the provision in one of the acts of the Assembly
of 1643 that appeals from the General Court (composed
of the Governor and Council, all appointees of the Crown) should
be made to the Grand Assembly (composed of the representatives
of the people plus the Governor and Council).</p>

<p>Still another demonstration of the <i>de facto</i> shift in power from
the Crown to the people was the third act of the 1643 Assembly
which declared that the Governor and Council "shall not lay any
taxes or impositions upon this collonie their lands or comodities
otherwise then by the authority of the Grand Assembly to be
leavied and imployed as by the Assembly shall be appointed."
The first such law had been passed in March 1624 and renewed
in February 1632. The process of wresting control of the purse
strings from the representatives of the Crown was to be a long-drawn-out
process in America, as indeed it was in England. In
Virginia the battle was won without a fight either because the
Governors were unable to oppose the power of the Burgesses or
because they identified their interests with those of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
In the case of the rights won by the people of Virginia during
Sir William Berkeley's governorship, these seem to have been the
results as much of the Governor's benevolence as of the Burgesses'
power.</p>

<p>The colony also took its economic welfare into its own hands
in the early years of Berkeley's administration. Dutch traders
were encouraged by an act which made it free and lawful for any
Dutch merchant or shipowner to bring merchandise into the
colony and to take tobacco out of it. Means were provided to
ease the difficulty caused by the requirement that the Dutch give
security for payment of the King's customs at the port of London.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">The Great Massacre and Indian War, 1644-1646</span></div>

<p>On April 18, 1644, occurred the second great Indian massacre
in Virginia's history. Opechancanough, King of the Pamunkey
Indian confederation, planned and executed the massacre, which
most historians attribute to the steadily increasing pressure exerted
by the English on the Indians' lands. The white population
had increased from 3,000 in 1630 to 8,000 in 1640, and more
were pouring in yearly. Nearly four hundred English, living in
exposed areas of the colony, reportedly lost their lives in the
massacre. The gallant young Berkeley, as proficient a soldier as
he was a playwright and courtier, struck back hard at the Indians.
The entire colony was put on a war footing. Campaigns, usually
by small mobile forces, were conducted against the Indians where
they could be found. The June Assembly passed an act for "perpetuall
warre with the Indians" promising to "pursue and root
out those which have any way had theire hands in the shedding
of our blood and massacring of our people."</p>

<p>As in the case of so many Indian wars, there was a difference
of opinion as to which Indian nations were guilty of the attack.
The Assembly's act attempted to restrict reprisals to those who
had actually perpetrated the massacre. Some individuals, however,
like Col. William Claiborne, seem to have desired to ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>tend
the reprisals to the Indians living between the Rappahannock
and the Potomac, where the land interests of Claiborne
and others were concentrated at this time.</p>

<p>Little progress was made in defeating the enemy in the early
months of the war. The Assembly, meeting in June 1644, foreseeing
ruin and desolation unless the colony could be furnished
with a greater supply of arms and ammunition, entreated Governor
Berkeley to return to England and implore His Majesty
for assistance to the country. The Assembly also commissioned
Mr. Cornelius Lloyd as agent for the colony to obtain what supplies
he could from the Dutch plantation in Hudson's River,
from the Swedish plantation on the Delaware, and from the
New England settlements.</p>

<p>It does not seem, from the records available, that either mission
was successful. Governor Berkeley found England involved in
full-scale war between the forces of the King and those of Parliament.
Instead of receiving aid from the King, Berkeley lent his
own assistance to the King's cause in his English campaigns.
Berkeley returned to Virginia a year later.</p>

<p>The mission of Virginia's agent to the northern colonies apparently
met with similar lack of success. Governor John Winthrop
of Massachusetts Bay attributed the massacre to Virginia's
expulsion of certain "godly ministers" sent from New England
a short time before, and told the Virginia agent that Massachusetts
could not spare the powder requested. When Massachusetts'
principal powder store shortly thereafter blew up, Winthrop
wondered whether God's wrath might not have been kindled
against the Bay Colony for her refusal to provide powder to fellow
Englishmen in need.</p>

<p>The war with Opechancanough continued throughout the
fall and winter of 1644 and into the spring of 1645. At the Assembly
of February 1645 provision was made for sending out the
usual military parties. But in addition three forts were ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
built: one in the Pamunkey territory, one at the falls of the James,
and a third along the Chickahominy.</p>

<p>Efforts were made to see that the expenses of the war were
equitably shared. The settlers at Northumberland, on the south
bank of the Potomac, were ordered to contribute to the cost of
the war on the north side of the James. Chickacoan, as the area
was known at first, had served for several years as a rallying
point for Protestants disaffected with the government of Lord
Baltimore, but this was the first official notice of the settlement
by the Virginia Assembly. Settlement along the Potomac was
significant, of course, because it placed a body of citizens farther
from effective control than any had been in the past. It had been
hard enough for Harvey to control the citizens on the south side
of the York River; now two broad rivers, the York and Rappahannock,
lay between the frontier settlements and Jamestown.</p>

<p>The Assembly of February 1645 found time to deal with matters
other than the conduct of the war. It passed an act providing
"That Free trade be allowed to all the inhabitants of the collony
to buy and sell at their best advantage." Because some questions
had been asked by the merchants of London concerning a rumored
prohibition of trade with them, it was thought fit to explain
that Virginia's free trade extended to them as to other
Englishmen.</p>

<p>Following Sir William Berkeley's return from England June 7,
1645, vigorous measures were taken to end the protracted war
with Opechancanough, and a new Assembly was called to reform
abuses which had sprung up. This Assembly met in November
and passed reform laws which demonstrate the concern Berkeley
had for satisfying all the legitimate grievances of the people.
Action was taken against innkeepers who charged unreasonable
rates and fraudulently mixed their wines and liquors with water.
Similar action was taken against millers who overcharged the
people. Attorneys at law who charged fees for their services were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
expelled from office, the colony having become outraged at their
exactions. The prohibition against professional attorneys continued
for a number of years before it was finally relaxed. Strict
regulations were instituted to curb the abuses of administrators
of deceased persons and orphans. Because of the trouble and
charge to plaintiffs and defendants of coming to Jamestown to
attend the General Court, county courts were allowed power to
try all causes at common law and equity. The tradition that appeals
should lie from county courts to the General Court and
from the General Court to the Assembly was reaffirmed. General
poll taxes, which had been reintroduced, were abolished on the
grounds that they were "inconvenient" and had "become insupportable
for the poorer sorte to beare." All levies were ordered
to be raised "by equall proportions out of the visible estates in
the collony." Exemptions from taxation extended to members
of the Council were canceled for the duration of the war. It
is not hard to imagine the praise that would have been heaped
on the initiator of such reforms, had it seemed that they were the
result of a democratic uprising.</p>

<p>In March 1646 the Assembly met again. The policy of building
forts had evidently been considered successful enough to
encourage the Assembly to order another, Fort Henry, constructed
at the falls of the Appomattox for the defense of the inhabitants
on the south side of the James River and to deprive the Indians
of their fishing in the area. The war had been going on for a
year and a half and the enemy forces were still not destroyed.
The Assembly, considering the vast expense that the conflict had
caused and considering "the almost impossibility of a further revenge
upon them, they being dispersed and driven from their
townes and habitations, lurking up and downe the woods in small
numbers, and that a peace (if honourably obtained) would conduce
to the better being and comoditie of the country," authorized
Capt. Henry Fleet, the colony's interpreter, and sixty men, to go
out and try to make a peace with Opechancanough. If they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
not make such a peace, they were to erect a fort on the Rappahannock
River or between it and the York.</p>

<p>The "break" in the war came with the daring capture of
Opechancanough himself by Governor Berkeley. Berkeley, who
frequently led the troops of the colony in the field, was apprised
of the Indian leader's whereabouts, and with characteristic boldness
led a troop of men in a raid on his headquarters. The raid
was successful: Opechancanough was captured and brought back
to Jamestown. The old chief, said to be over 100 years, acted
the part of Emperor of the Indian confederation with grave dignity.
The historian Robert Beverley tells us that one day the
nearly blind warrior heard "a great noise of the treading of people
about him; upon which he caused his eye-lids to be lifted up;
and finding that a crowd of people were let in to see him, he call'd
in high indignation for the Governour; who being come, Opechancanough
scornfully told him, that had it been his fortune to take
Sir William Berkeley prisoner, he should not meanly have exposed
him as a show to the people." Berkeley accepted the rebuke,
and ordered him treated with all the dignity due his position as
the leader of many Indian nations. Unfortunately the life of
Opechancanough was shortly after snuffed out by one of his
guards who shot him in the back, despite his defenseless condition.</p>

<p>Peace was concluded with Necotowance, Opechancanough's
successor, by the first act of the October 1646 Assembly. The
treaty is a document of historic importance. Under its provisions
Necotowance acknowledged that he held his kingdom from the
King of England and that his successors might be appointed or
confirmed by the King's Governors. Twenty beaver skins were
to be paid to the Governor yearly "at the going away of the geese"
in acknowledgment of this subjection. Necotowance and his people
were given freedom to inhabit and hunt on the north side
of York River without interference from the English, provided
that if the Governor and Council thought fit to permit any English
to inhabit the lower reaches of the peninsula, where land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
grants had been made before the massacre, Necotowance first
should be acquainted therewith. Necotowance in turn surrendered
all claim to the land between the falls of the James and
the York rivers downward to Chesapeake Bay. Indians were not
allowed on this land unless specially designated as messengers
to the English. Similarly it was a felony for an Englishmen to
repair to the north side of the York River except temporarily
under special conditions authorized by the Governor.</p>

<p>The significance of the treaty lies in the fact that the Indians
were to be treated as equals, with equal rights to live on the land
with the English and to enjoy the rights of human beings. They
were no longer considered as vermin to be exterminated whenever
the opportunity presented itself. For the first time in Virginia's
history, the Indian was considered to have an unquestioned legal
right to the land. The setting aside of a reservation for the Indians
into which English intrusion was forbidden marked the end of
the "perpetual enmity" policy of earlier days. When differences
arose, they might still be settled by peace or by war, but the right
of either side to exist would not be questioned.</p>

<p>Despite the improvement in the status of the Indian nations
occasioned by the treaty of 1646 it proved impossible to preserve
their rights in the face of the enormous increase in English population.
The fate of the eastern Indians proved identical to the
fate of their western brothers in the nineteenth century, when
white population increased around the areas set aside for Indian
occupancy. But in Virginia the attempt was made to establish
a fair settlement, and Governor Berkeley honestly and courageously
labored to keep faith with the Indians, even though he
lost popularity and eventually his position as a result.</p>

<p>The Assembly of October 1646 also provided for the maintenance
of the forts built during the war. This was done by
granting the land on which they were built, plus adjoining acres,
to individuals who would guarantee to maintain the forts and to
keep a certain number of men constantly on the place. By this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
method the valuable forts of the colony were preserved, yet the
people were spared the heavy taxes that would normally have
been necessary to maintain them.</p>

<p>The Assembly made further provision that those who had
settled along the Potomac in Northumberland should not be allowed
to avoid taxes as they had done during the war. The English
in this remote area had evidently ignored the act of the
February 1645 Assembly which attempted to tax them, and followed
instead their own interests, free from any effective control
by Virginia's government during the conflict with Opechancanough.</p>

<p>Finally the October Assembly enacted the strictest and most
democratic voting law ever made in Virginia. Not only were all
freemen (as well as covenanted servants) allowed to vote, but
they were fined 100 pounds of tobacco for failing to do so. This
act seems to have continued in effect until 1655 when the Assembly
prohibited freemen from voting unless they were also
householders.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">The Administration of Berkeley in 1647-1648: Trade and
Expansion</span></div>

<p>Following the war Virginia returned to its two great peacetime
interests&mdash;trade and expansion. In the Assembly of April 1647
Berkeley, the Council, and the Burgesses joined in a declaration
which reveals the extent to which the colony relied on Dutch
traders. It noted that "absolute necessities" had caused earlier
Assemblies to invite the Dutch to trade with the inhabitants of
Virginia, "which now for some few yeares they have injoyed
with such content, comfort and releife that they esteeme the
continuance thereof, of noe lesse consequence then as a relative
to theire being and subsistence." Rumors had been raised, the
declaration went on, that by a recent ordinance of Parliament, all
foreigners were prohibited from trading with any of the English
plantations "which wee conceive to bee the invention of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
English merchants on purpose to affright and expell the Dutch,
and make way for themselves to monopolize not onely our labours
and fortunes, but even our persons." The declaration noted the
baneful effects on the colony of the greed of the English merchants
and pointed out that by ancient charter and right the inhabitants
of Virginia were allowed to trade with any nation in
amity with the King. It would be inconceivable that Parliament
would abridge this right "especially without hearing of the parties
principally interested, which infringeth noe lesse the libertye of
the Collony and a right of deare esteeme to free borne persons:
<i>viz.</i>, that no lawe should bee established within the kingdome
of England concerninge us without the consent of a grand Assembly
here." But since they had heard nothing officially concerning
the rumored act, "wee can interprett noe other thing
from the report, then a forgerye of avaritious persons, whose
sickle hath bin ever long in our harvest allreadye." To provide
for Virginia's subsistence the Governor, Council, and Burgesses
ordered that the right of the Dutch nation to trade with Virginia
be reiterated and preserved, and her traders given every protection.</p>

<p>Virginia's other great problem, that of unregulated expansion,
was dealt with by the Grand Assembly of November 1647 in an
extraordinary way. The Governor, Council, and Burgesses ordered
that persons inhabiting Northumberland and "other remote
and straying plantations on the south side of Patomeck River,
Wicokomoko, Rappahannock and Fleets Bay" be displanted and
removed. They justified this act on the basis of frequent instructions
from the King to Berkeley and the Council directing that
the planters not be allowed to scatter themselves too widely,
and also because they considered such settlement "pernicious"
and "destructive" to the peace and safety of the colony, animating
the Indians to attack, and thus imbroiling the country in troublesome
and expensive wars. Since winter was approaching, the inhabitants
were allowed one year to remove themselves to the
south side of York River.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The same session of the Assembly authorized Capt. Edward
Hill and others to establish, at the head of Rappahannock River,
a military and trading outpost which was deemed valuable to the
peace and safety of the colony. Hill and his associates were to
provide forty men to man the fort which was not to exceed five
acres at most, on pain of having the grant revoked.</p>

<p>It was a brave and sensible policy which Berkeley and the Assembly
pursued, but one that was destined to be overridden by
the power, self-interest, and numbers of the thousands of new
members of the colony, both those being born in Virginia in ever-increasing
numbers, and those who had left behind them the
civil strife of England. In less than a year the Assembly enacted
that the tract of land between the Rappahannock and Potomac
rivers should be called Northumberland and that it should have
power to elect Burgesses. The reasons of "state" that had convinced
the Assembly of November 1647 to order the utter dissolution of
the Northumberland settlements were thus thrown to the winds
by the next Assembly. No doubt the pressure of the inhabitants,
would-be inhabitants, and speculators, in addition to the difficulty
of enforcing the decision, caused the repeal of the act. The restraining
hand of the Governor was never again to be felt as it
had been in the period following the 1646 peace. The explosive
growth of settlement in Virginia had proved impossible to control.</p>

<p>The justification of the settlement south of the Potomac River
was not the only victory of the people in the Assembly of October
1648. Upon the representation of the Burgesses to the Governor
and Council complaining of the worn-out lands and insufficient
cattle ranges of the earlier settlements, the Governor and Council,
after long debate, joined the Burgesses in authorizing settlement
on the north side of the York and Rappahannock rivers. The act
declared, however, that "for reasons of state to ... [the Governor
and Council] appearing, importing the safety of the people in
their seating," no one was to go there before the first of September<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the following year. Surveys of the area were allowed at once,
however, and land patents were authorized to be taken out. The
act making it a felony to go to the north side of York River was
repealed. The settlers' and speculators' victory was complete. Reasons
of "policy" and "state" proved only of sufficient power to delay
the inevitable.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Execution of Charles I and Capture of Colony by
Parliamentary Forces, 1649-1652</span></div>

<p>On January 30, 1649, King Charles I was beheaded by the
Parliamentary forces. It was a logical climax to the turmoil into
which English institutions and values had been cast by the long
years of civil war that preceded the deed. The execution of the
King shocked Englishmen as well as foreigners. The reaction of
the Virginians came in the form of Act I of the Assembly of
October 1649 which hailed "the late most excellent and now
undoubtedly sainted king," denounced the perpetrators of the
deed, and declared that if any person in the colony should defend
"the late traiterous proceedings ... under any notion of law and
justice" by words or speeches, such person should be adjudged
an accessory <i>post factum</i> to the death of the King. Anyone who
expressed doubt, by words and speeches, as to the inherent right
of Charles II to succeed his father as King of England and Virginia,
was likewise to be adjudged guilty of high treason.</p>

<p>The death of Charles I left the Parliamentary forces supreme
in England. Some royalists retired to the continent of Europe,
and some came to Virginia. England became a Commonwealth
without a King; Oliver Cromwell was later named Protector. The
new government, after consolidating its power in England, attempted
to extend its control over the colonies, some of which,
like Virginia, continued to demonstrate their loyalty to royal authority.
On October 3, 1650, Parliament, as a punitive measure,
prohibited the trade of the colonies with foreign nations except
as the Parliamentary government should allow. "This succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to the exercise of the kingly authority," wrote Jefferson later,
"gave the first colour for parliamentary interference with the colonies,
and produced that fatal precedent which they continued
to follow after they had retired, in other respects, within their
proper functions."</p>

<p>The reaction of the Virginia Burgesses to this act was as violent
as their reaction to the beheading of Charles I. Their temper
on both occasions owed much to the eloquence of their Governor,
and to the admiration in which he was held by the people. In
March 1651 they met to consider the Parliamentary threat to their
beliefs and to their livelihood. Sir William Berkeley spoke to them
on the subject of Parliament's claim to speak for the English nation.
Said the Governor:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>If the whole current of their reasoning were not as ridiculous, as
their actions have been tyrannicall and bloudy, we might wonder with
what browes they could sustaine such impertinent assertions: For if
you looke into it, the strength of their argument runs onely thus: we
have laid violent hands on your land-lord, possessed his manner
house where you used to pay your rents, therfore now tender your
respects to the same house you once reverenced.... They talke indeed
of money laid out on this country in its infancy: I will not say
how little, nor how centuply repaid, but will onely aske, was it
theirs?... Surely Gentlemen we are more slaves by nature, then
their power can make us if we suffer our selves to be shaken with
these paper bulletts, and those on my life are the heaviest they either
can or will send us.</p></div>

<p>Berkeley was confident that if Virginia put up a determined
resistance, the new English rulers would beg the colony to trade
with them. He compared the state of England with the state of
Virginia, to the disadvantage of the former. The Parliamentary
government of England, he asserted, did not represent the will
of the people who would not endure their "slavery, if the sword
at their throats did not compell them to languish under the misery
they howrely suffer." As for Virginia, "there is not here an arbitrary
hand that dares to touch the substance of either poore or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
rich." Berkeley called on the Burgesses to support his stand against
the act, asking:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>What is it can be hoped for in a change, which we have not allready?
Is it liberty? The sun looks not on a people more free then we
are from all oppression. Is it wealth? Hundreds of examples shew us
that industry and thrift in a short time may bring us to as high a
degree of it, as the country and our conditions are yet capable of:
Is it securely to enjoy this wealth when gotten? With out blushing
I will speake it, I am confident theare lives not that person can accuse
me of attempting the least act against any mans property. Is it peace?
The Indians, God be blessed round about us are subdued; we can
onely feare the Londoners, who would faine bring us to the same
poverty, wherein the Dutch found and relieved us; would take away
the liberty of our consciences, and tongues, and our right of giving
and selling our goods to whom we please. But Gentlemen by the Grace
of God we will not so tamely part with our King, and all these blessings
we enjoy under him; and if they oppose us, do but follow me, I
will either lead you to victory, or loose a life which I cannot more
gloriously sacrifice then for my loyalty, and your security.</p></div>

<p>The speech being ended the House of Burgesses, unanimously
with the Governor and Council, agreed to reject the Parliamentary
act of October 3, 1650, as illegal, and to continue in allegiance
to King Charles II, always praying for his restoration to the throne
and for the repentance of those who, "to the hazard of their soules"
opposed him. The Assembly proclaimed that they would continue
to trade freely with all persons of whatever nation who came to
trade with them, not excluding the Londoners.</p>

<p>This assertion of Virginia's traditional freedom and rights was,
of course, a direct challenge to the Parliamentary government. In
the fall of 1651 that government determined to chastise the rebellious
colony and subject it by force. A fleet was dispatched in
October to conquer Virginia and Barbados, another rebellious
colony. Robert Dennis, Richard Bennett, Thomas Stegge, and
William Claiborne were chosen commissioners to take over the
government of Virginia once it had been conquered. Bennett and
Claiborne were living in Virginia at the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Part of the fleet arrived in Virginia waters in January 1652.
Berkeley called upon the people to prepare for resistance. One
thousand troops, it is said, gathered in James City for the purpose.
Five hundred Indian allies of the colony promised their aid. Berkeley
denounced the leaders of the Parliamentary expedition as
bloody tyrants, pirates, and robbers. He warned the Virginians
that, if they did not repel the attack, their land titles would be
thrown into doubt and they would be brought under a company
of merchants who would order them at their pleasure and keep
them from trade with all others. To counteract the Governor's
influence, the Parliamentary commissioners circulated letters and
declarations throughout the country denying any such evil intentions.
Finally, on January 19, they sent a summons to the Governor
and Council to surrender, and set sail from the lower reaches
of the James to Jamestown. A milder answer than expected was
returned, setting forth various demands and privileges desired by
the Virginians.</p>

<p>The commissioners' reply to these proposals was favorable
enough to cause Berkeley to call an Assembly, and negotiations
were entered into between the Governor, Council, and Burgesses
on the one hand, and the Parliamentary commissioners on the
other. Articles of submission were agreed upon which were honorable
to both sides, Virginia receiving guarantees of the privileges
of freeborn people of England, authority for the Grand Assembly
to continue to function, guarantees of immunity for acts or words
done or spoken in opposition to Parliament, guarantees of the
bounds of Virginia, of the fifty-acre headright privilege, and of
the right to "free trade as the people of England do enjoy to all
places and with all nations according to the lawes of that commonwealth."
Special provisions were made which allowed the Governor
and Council to refrain from taking any oath to the Commonwealth
for one year and guaranteed them for one year from
censure for speaking well of the King in their private houses.
Berkeley and the Council were given leave to sell their estates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
quit Virginia, either for England or Holland. No penalties were
to be imposed on those who had served the King.</p>

<p>The commissioners of Parliament considered that they had been
lucky to reduce the colony without bloodshed, even though forced
to agree to such mild terms. At the same time the event suggests
that the bitterness which existed in England between Roundheads
and Cavaliers was not quite so extreme in the colonies,
where little blood had been shed for the cause of either. The
colonies had interests of their own which ran counter to those of
the mother country, whether in the hands of King or Parliament.
Governor, Council, and Burgesses in Virginia were closer to each
other economically and politically than they were to their respective
counterparts in England. What held the colonies to the
mother country was not self-interest but ties of historical tradition
and racial patriotism. The execution of Charles I and seizure of
the colony by the Parliamentary fleet loosened these ties. The
Crown, symbol of continuity with past ages of English subjects
and of unity among all the King's realms, was now not only removed
but denounced by those who had done the deed.</p>

<p>Virginia never showed sympathy for those who had killed the
King, and the Assembly took to heart Governor Berkeley's warning
of 1651 that the blood of Charles I "will yet staine your
garments if you willingly submit to those murtherers hands that
shed it." It is true that following the surrender the Parliamentary
commissioners agreed with the representatives of the people on
a provisional government for Virginia, but the bonds that held
Virginia to England had lost much of the cement of love and
tradition. Local and self-interest were now to dominate to a great
extent Virginia's actions. Such motives had always been latent,
and indeed active. But under royal government, the Governor
could often exert a countervailing force to prevent such interests
from overriding the interests of nation and morality.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the settlement the Grand Assembly was
to continue to function, and the Assembly and commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
agreed that Richard Bennett, one of the commissioners, should
act as Governor for a year. It was expected that orders would shortly
arrive from England establishing new patterns of government.
Such instructions were especially necessary to determine the role
and authority of the Governor and Council, formerly appointed
by the King. The new rulers in England were made aware of the
need for a new policy for the colonies, but they never found time
to make the necessary decisions. At intervals the colonists were
informed that Cromwell had not forgotten them and that His
Highness would soon let them know his pleasure. But instructions
never came except spasmodically and inadequately. The
merchants who stood to gain from the Navigation Act of 1651,
which generally excluded foreign ships from the colonies and attempted
to restrain colonial trade with foreign countries, complained
at the failure of the colonists to obey the act and demanded
that orders be sent to enforce it, but no adequate provisions were
ever made.</p>

<p>Thus the colony was left to its own devices during the period.
Virginia traders paid little attention to Parliamentary restrictions
on their commerce. They insisted that the provision of the Articles
of Surrender allowing them free trade with all nations according
to the laws of the Commonwealth did not prevent them from
trading with foreigners. They argued that since the first article
of the surrender agreement guaranteed them the rights of freeborn
Englishmen, an act discriminating against them in matters of trade
because they happened to live in the colonies was illegal. Dutch
ships called often, though perhaps not so frequently as some have
believed, and individual Virginians traded as they pleased with
the Dutch and English colonies in America.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Expansion in Virginia, 1650-1656</span></div>

<p>The existence of a weak executive, dependent on the people
for his authority, inevitably brought about a dispersal of power
and authority from the center to the outer edges of settlement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The explosive force of expansion was no longer limited by the
strong hand of a royal Governor, and each increment of population
in the colony and power in the hands of the local authorities
added fuel to the combustion.</p>

<p>One of Virginia's frontiers at this time was the Eastern Shore.
It was a frontier community because the law of the colonial government
in Jamestown rarely extended to it. The local commissioners
of the county court, later called "justices," provided what
justice existed on the Eastern Shore. But since these commissioners
were sometimes the worst offenders against the policies of the
Governor, Council, and Burgesses, justice was often sacrificed to
interest, especially when Indians were involved. The leaders on
the Eastern Shore, like Edmund Scarborough, were among the
richest men and greatest landowners of the colony. They conducted
the county's business as if it were their own, which indeed
it was to a great extent. Their oppression of the Eastern Shore
Indians makes a sorry history, despite the efforts of Governor
Berkeley to restrain them. In April 1650, for example, Berkeley
was forced to write to the commissioners of Northampton asking
them not to allow any land to be taken from the Laughing King
Indians. Berkeley pointed out that during the massacre of 1644
these Indians had remained faithful to the English. How could
Virginia expect them to do the same again, asked Berkeley, "unless
we correspond with them in acts of charity and amity, especially
unless we abstain from acts of rapine and violence, which
they say we begin to do, by taking away their land from them,
by pretence of the sale of a patent."</p>

<p>Honest attempts were made both before and after the retirement
of Sir William Berkeley in 1652 to restrain the frontier
barons in their savage attacks on unsuspecting Indian towns. But
often the law was too weak and the guilty too strong. Neither
the Indians in front of them nor the government behind them had
the power to curb their desires except in a limited fashion. This
was one of the benefits&mdash;to the frontiersmen&mdash;of living under Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>lish
law. The government could not effectively restrain the Englishman
nor protect the Indian. As a result the reckless expansion
went on into the lands of other tribes. As each new Indian tribe
was reached the same dismal pattern of subjugation or extirpation
was repeated, despite the efforts of the Governor and Council
to see that the rights of the Indians were preserved.</p>

<p>Every extension of settlement strengthened local rule. In May
1652 the people of Northampton County, which comprised the
whole of the Eastern Shore of Virginia, protested to the Assembly
against a tax levied on them, asserting that since they had not sent
representatives to the Assembly since 1647, except for one Burgess
in 1651, they did not think the Assembly could tax them.
They asked that they be allowed to have a separate government
and the right to try all causes in their own courts. Although
Northampton was not allowed to dissociate itself entirely from
the rest of Virginia, acts of 1654 and 1656 allowed the county
to constitute laws and customs for itself on matters dealing with
Indians and manufactures.</p>

<p>Virginia's most important frontier region in the 1650's was the
area along the Potomac River, although settlement went on
simultaneously westward up the James, York, and Rappahannock,
southward into Carolina, and northward up the Eastern Shore to
Maryland. Sometimes individuals obtained grants to explore, settle,
and monopolize the trade of these regions. But usually the
expansion was catch as catch can. Since land travel was still more
difficult than water travel, expansion up the Potomac, the last
great unsettled tidewater river, was fastest. Individuals who already
had plantations in the older areas of settlement around
Jamestown sailed their barques up the Potomac and, without
bothering to go ashore, took the bounds of likely pieces of land.
The best spots were often the corn fields of the Indians and sometimes
the very towns where they lived. The fact that the Indians
occupied the land counted for little in the thoughts of the settlers
and speculators who flocked to the area.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Following their surveys, the explorers rushed back to James
City and put in claims for the waterfront acreages, presenting one
"headright"&mdash;proof that someone had been imported into the colony
by their agency&mdash;for every fifty acres. The Patent Books of
the colony frequently show signs of fraud in the presentation of
headrights. Occasionally more land was granted than the claimant
was entitled to on the basis of the headrights he presented. But
the headright system, even imperfectly administered, remained
during the Parliamentary period as one of the elements of restraint
on the unbounded desires of the planters. Land acquisition was
thus tied in a fixed ratio to population increase. There was, as a
result, some assurance that land acquired would be populated and
farmed. It was not until late in the seventeenth century that anyone
could buy land for money alone, a practice which enabled
some individuals in the eighteenth century to obtain holdings
exceeding 100,000 acres. In the middle of the seventeenth century
10,000 acres was a practical "top" limit.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Commonwealth period in Virginia
a number of new counties were set up. The Assembly of April
1652 listed two new ones: Gloucester, north of the York, and
Lancaster, north of the Rappahannock. The Assembly of November
1652 listed Surry, south of the James, for the first time. Settlers
had moved into these areas earlier when they were parts of
other counties, and in two cases the county organization may have
been set up prior to April 1652. The Assembly of July 1653, in
addition to authorizing exploration and settlement on the Roanoke
and Chowan rivers in present-day North Carolina, and
exploration into the Appalachian Mountains, ordered that a county
to be called Westmoreland should be set up west of Northumberland
County on the Potomac, with boundaries from Machodoc
River to the falls of the Potomac above the town of the Anacostan
Indians. It was thus intended not only to include in the new
county all the lands of the Doeg Indians, but also those of the
Anacostans. The Assembly of November 1654 authorized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
establishment of New Kent County along both sides of the upper
York River and far up the Pamunkey and Mattaponi rivers.</p>

<p>The Assembly of November 1654 also authorized the three
new northern counties of Lancaster, Northumberland, and Westmoreland
to march against the Rappahannock Indians to punish
various "injuries and insolencies offered" by them. One hundred
men were to be raised in Lancaster, forty in Northumberland,
and thirty in Westmoreland. The commissioners of these counties
were authorized to raise the troops, and one of their number was
appointed commander-in-chief of the expedition. He was to march
to the Rappahannock Indian town and demand and receive
"such satisfaction as he shall thinke fitt for the severall injuries
done unto the said inhabitants not using any acts of hostility but
defensive in case of assault." The charge of the war was to be
borne by the three counties concerned. This expedition was like
many others that both preceded and followed it. In each case,
enormous authority and responsibility were given to local officials
who were themselves frequently the leading oppressors of the
Indians. Such expeditions not infrequently took on the character
of private wars between the big landowners of the frontier and
the Indian towns in the vicinity. The Governor, Council, and
Burgesses frequently heard the complaints of the local settlers,
but rarely the complaints of the Indians. The authorization to the
local community to administer justice to the Indians often proved
a cover for their expulsion or extirpation.</p>

<p>The usual grievances of the settlers against the Indians were
not the violent murders and massacres so often associated in the
public mind with Indian-white relations, but minor irritations
concerning property and animals. The settlers let their hogs run
wild. The hogs would get into the Indians' corn. The Indians
would kill the hogs. The settlers would demand satisfaction. Many
acts of the Assembly testify to the fact that shooting of wild hogs
was one of the most frequent points of dispute not only between
the English and the Indians but among the English themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
It was one reason why early Assemblies provided strict rules for
erecting adequate fences around cultivated fields and establishing
lines of responsibility for damage caused by straying cattle or hogs.
On the frontier, however, such refinements of civilization as fences
were long in coming. What was more natural than that the same
conflicts which arose among the English in the early years of
settlement should arise between the English and the Indians on
the frontier. The tragedy was that English-Indian conflicts were
not normally settled in the courts as were conflicts between Englishmen.
The courts did deal with Indian-white conflicts to a
certain extent, but, as noted before, the local justices were often
the very persons the Indians accused of oppressing them. Sometimes
the Indians were able to bring their complaints before the
General Court in Jamestown. But often the dispute was settled
in the wilderness in the traditional frontier way: by violence.
Since the settlers had weapons of violence superior to those possessed
by the Indians, it was not very frequently that the Indians
won their "case."</p>

<p>In the Assemblies of these years there is occasional mention
of the splitting of counties in two parts, or of the formation of
new parishes. Usually these divisions were made along rivers or
streams. Such legislation suggests that settlement was spreading
back from the water routes into the land area between streams.
The early counties were normally set up to embrace the area on
both sides of watercourses, even broad rivers like the James and
York. The rivers were, in the early period of settlement, bonds
that linked the settlers on either side to each other. It was natural
that rivers should be the principal thoroughfares of the country.
But as settlement spread into the interior, up the tributary streams
that issued into the larger rivers, the natural social unit that developed
was that of communities on the same side of the river.
Hence the gradual conversion of rivers into political boundaries.</p>

<p>The Assembly of March 1655, for the first time in Virginia's
history, restricted the voting privilege to "housekeepers whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
freeholders, leaseholders, or otherwise tenants." Freemen who
could not qualify as householders, even though they may have
been grown sons living in their father's house, could not vote. It
is significant that this first restriction on the right to vote in Virginia
came not under a royal governor, but under so-called "Parliamentary"
rule. So unpopular was this enactment that it was
amended by an act of the Assembly of March 1656 on the grounds
that "we conceive it something hard and unagreeable to reason
that any persons shall pay equall taxes and yet have no votes in
elections." Freemen were again allowed to vote provided that they
did not do so "in a tumultuous way."</p>

<p>The Assembly of March 1656 passed an act which attempted
to solve the Indian problem in a way that had never been tried
before but has been frequently tried since. The plan was to encourage
the growth of an acquisitive spirit among the Indians to
serve as a counterweight to the acquisitive spirit of the English.
The preamble to the act asserted that the danger of war from
the Indians stemmed from two causes: "our extreame pressures
on them and theire wanting of something to hazard and loose
beside their lives." Therefore the Assembly enacted that for every
eight wolves' heads brought in by the Indians, the King or great
man of the Indians should have a cow delivered to him at the
public charge. "This will be a step to civilizing them and to making
them Christians," the act went on; "besides it will certainly
make the comanding Indians watch over their own men that they
do us no injuries, knowing that by theire default they may be in
danger of losing their estates." The Assembly also attempted to
make the lands possessed by the Indians under the seal of the
colony inalienable to the English. Otherwise, constant pressure on
the Indians by the settlers would force them over and over again
to dispose of their lands.</p>

<p>Many people fail to realize that the Indians of Virginia lived in
well-defined towns or settlements. It was, indeed, the Indians who
lived an "urban" life in the seventeenth century while the Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>lish
settlers were usually scattered about the countryside. The conventional
picture of the Indian roaming the forests, living solely
by hunting and fishing, is mistaken. The Indian did hunt and
fish, as many of us do today. But his support came in large measure
from the corn and vegetables growing in the fields which adjoined
every Indian town. The Indians had a close-knit and harmonious
community life. They were only indirectly touched by
the white man's money economy and were usually content to
raise only what food they needed for their own consumption.
They were not infected with the restless, individualistic spirit of
the white settler who constantly worked to accumulate a monetary
surplus from the returns on his single cash crop, tobacco.</p>

<p>Like later attempts to destroy the group-centered society of the
Indians in favor of a self-centered society, this attempt of 1656
was not completely successful.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Indian Troubles, 1656-1658</span></div>

<p>Early in 1656 word was received that six or seven hundred
strange Indians from the mountains had come down and seated
themselves near the falls of the James. The March Assembly,
considering how much blood it had cost to "expell and extirpate
those perfidious and treacherous Indians which were there formerly,"
and considering how the area lay within the limits "which
in a just warr were formerly conquered by us," ordered the two
upper counties under Col. Edward Hill to send 100 men to
remove the intruders peacefully, making war only in self-defense.
Messages were sent to obtain the aid of the Pamunkeys,
Chickahominies, and other neighboring Indians. Tottopottomoy, the
King of the Pamunkeys, joined Hill with 100 of his warriors,
although only the summer before his brother had been murdered
by an Englishman.</p>

<p>The western Indians had apparently come down to treat with
the English about trade, bringing with them many beaver skins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to begin the commerce. Col. Hill, however, despite the Assembly's
command to avoid the use of force, perfidiously had five of
the kings who came to parley with him put to death. "This unparalleled
hellish treachery and anti-christian perfidy more to be
detested than any heathenish inhumanity," a contemporary wrote,
"cannot but stink most abominably in the nosetrils of as many
Indians, as shall be infested with the least scent of it, even to
their perpetual abhorring and abandoning of the very sight and
name of an English man, till some new generation of a better
extract shall be transplanted among them!" In the fight that
ensued Tottopottomoy lost his life fighting bravely for the English.
Despite his fidelity, neither he nor his tribe was honorably
treated by the English, the very land he owned being extorted
from him and his successors.</p>

<p>Hill himself was found guilty by the unanimous vote of the
Burgesses and Council of "crimes and weaknesses" in his conduct
of the campaign. He was ordered suspended from all offices,
military and civil, and made liable for the charge of procuring a
peace with the Indians with whom he had so treacherously dealt.</p>

<p>The disgraceful episode of Hill's campaign may have caused
some soul-searching in the Assembly that met following the
event, for, in addition to censuring Hill, it repealed an act which
had made it lawful to kill an Indian committing a trespass. It
pointed out that since the oath of the person killing the Indian
was considered sufficient evidence to prove the alleged trespass,
killing Indians, "though never so innocent," had come to be of
"small account" with the settlers. Since the colony would probably
be involved in endless wars and might "expect a success answerable
to the injustice of our beginning if no act be made for the
future to prevent this wanton and unnecessary shedding of
blood," the Assembly attempted to provide some protection for
the Indians.</p>

<p>That expansion into the Indians' territory continued is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
by the authorization given by this same Assembly of December
1656 to form the county of Rappahannock on both sides of the
Rappahannock River above Lancaster County. Confirmation of
the movement towards the frontier is shown in the report to the
same Assembly by the sheriffs of Isle of Wight County and
Elizabeth City County, both at the mouth of the James River,
that their counties were overrated in the tax lists of "tithable"
persons by thirty-eight and thirty-two persons respectively. The
Assembly ordered that their tax allotments should be reduced
accordingly and laid upon Lancaster County "where they are
increased since the last year's list 152 persons." An act of the
Assembly of March 1658 similarly took note of the numbers of
inhabitants who had "deserted their plantations and receded
into the bay of Chisapeake" without having satisfied their creditors.
It prescribed penalties for removing without notice.</p>

<p>Bills guaranteeing the Indians their lands, justice, and personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
freedom continued to pass. The acts freely admitted that
previous guarantees to this effect had been ineffective and that
"manie English doe still intrench upon the said Indians' land,"
which the Assembly conceived to be "contrary to justice, and the
true intent of the English plantation in this country." Nevertheless
attempts to legislate justice for the Indians continued.
It could not be done. The power of the Assembly's acts was not
equal to the power of the frontiersmen's muskets. However, the
acts of the Assembly were not without effect, and in many cases
served their purpose. One of the most notable acts of this Assembly
provided that no grants of land should be made to any
Englishman in the future until the Indians had first been guaranteed
fifty acres for each bowman. The good intent of this act
seems to have been a direct consequence of the practice that had
arisen in the preceding years of granting patents to Englishmen
for land occupied by the Indians. It was an attempt to make sure
that the Indians would not be wholly dispossessed to satisfy the
land hunger of the English.</p>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Parliamentary Governors, 1652-1659</span></div>

<p>Early writers on Virginia history tended to overemphasize how
completely affairs in Virginia during the Commonwealth and
Protectorate periods were in the hands of the House of Burgesses.
Still, the House did assume to itself many of the powers of government
in the period and asserted its ultimate authority in all
other matters. It took this position out of necessity, and always
with the proviso that, should instructions come from the supreme
power in England, it would obey them.</p>

<p>The first Governor under the Commonwealth, Richard Bennett,
was appointed by an act of Assembly on April 30, 1652, his
term to last for one year or until the following meeting of the
Assembly, with the further proviso that the appointment should
be in effect "untill the further pleasures of the states be knowne."
Bennett, a planter of Nansemond County, was a Puritan in his
religious outlook and was one of those who had invited New
England to send ministers to Virginia in the early 1640's. When
Parliament decided to conquer the colony in 1651 it appointed
him one of the commissioners for the enterprise. It is probable
that the secret instructions issued to Bennett by the Parliamentary
authorities required him to come to some agreement with the
Burgesses on who should be Governor until a more formal commission
for the office should issue from the supreme power in
England. However, as the years passed, and as instructions from
England failed to deal with Virginia's problems, the House of
Burgesses asserted its prerogative more and more.</p>

<p>On March 31, 1655, Edward Digges was elected Governor
by the Assembly to replace Bennett. Digges was the son of Sir
Dudley Digges, Master of the Rolls under Charles I. He came to
Virginia sometime before 1650 and bought a plantation on the
York River, subsequently known as "Bellfield." The plantation
become famous for the quality of the tobacco grown there, and
was also the scene of Digges's efforts at silk production, in the
culture of which he employed three Armenians. When Digges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
decided to return to England in 1656, Samuel Mathews was
elected to succeed him. There is some confusion as to whether
Governor Mathews was the man who so bedeviled Sir John Harvey
in the 1630's, or his son of the same name.</p>

<p>When Mathews and the Council attempted to dissolve the
Assembly on April 1, 1658, the Burgesses answered that the
Governor's action was illegal, and that they would remain and
complete their work. Mathews refused to concede their point
formally, though he declared his willingness to allow them to
continue in fact while the dispute was submitted to the Lord
Protector in England. The Burgesses declared his answer unsatisfactory.
They demanded a specific acknowledgment that
the House remained undissolved. Mathews and the Council
finally agreed to revoke the declaration of dissolution, but still
insisted on referring the dispute to the Lord Protector. The House
rejected this answer as well, asserting that the present power of
Virginia resided in the Burgesses, who were not dissolvable by
any power extant in Virginia but themselves. They directed the
High Sheriff of James City County not to execute any warrant
but from the Speaker of the House. In addition, they ordered
Col. William Claiborne, the Secretary of the Council, to surrender
the records of the country into the hands of John Smith,
the Speaker of the Assembly, on the basis of the Burgesses'
declaration to hold "supreame power of this country."</p>

<p>That the House of Burgesses did not mean its actions to be in
defiance of the power that existed in England, however, is shown
by its agreement to proclaim Richard, son of Oliver Cromwell,
Lord Protector when the Governor sent down, at the March 1659
session, an official letter from His Highness' Council requiring
that it be done. Immediately after agreeing to proclaim Richard,
the Burgesses decided to address the new Lord Protector for
confirmation of the privilege granted to the Assembly, perhaps
under the terms of Bennett's secret instructions, to elect its own
officers. Although the Speaker of the House assured the Burgesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that the Governor was willing to join them in such a request,
some of the Burgesses expressed a desire to hear the assurance
from the Governor's own lips. Accordingly, he was sent for and,
to the satisfaction of the Burgesses, "acknowledged the supream
power of electing officers to be by the present lawes resident in
the Grand Assembly." He promised to join them in requesting
confirmation of these privileges from His Highness.</p>

<p>The Assembly, at this same session, passed an act electing
Mathews Governor again for two years "and then the Grand
Assembly to elect a Governour as they shall think fitt." The act
was to be in force "until his Highness pleasure be further signified."
William Claiborne was appointed Secretary of State on
his acknowledgment that he received the place from the Assembly,
and with the proviso that he should continue Secretary until
the next Assembly or until the Lord Protector's pleasure should
be further signified to the colony.</p>

<p>The Assembly of 1659 marks the high water point of local
government in Virginia. Not only were the Burgesses supreme
in matters of general legislation, compelling the Governor and
Secretary to bow to their sovereign power, but in their home
counties affairs were conducted much as the local justices saw
fit. The Assembly of 1659 even authorized free trade with the
Indians by anyone in any goods&mdash;even guns and ammunition.
Never before had regulation on a point of such vital interest to
the security of the colony been so utterly abandoned.</p>


<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Recall of Sir William Berkeley by the Assembly,
1659-1660</span></div>

<p>Soon after the Assembly of March 1659 ended, Richard Cromwell
resigned the reins of government in England. The English
nation was again plunged into turmoil. Letters arriving in Virginia
spoke of the people divided "some for one Government
some for another." The prospect of London "burned into Ashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and the streets running with blood" was held a likely outcome
of the divisions.</p>

<p>In the midst of this troublous situation, Governor Mathews
died. The next Assembly met in March 1660. In a move that
has astonished historians since that time it asked Sir William
Berkeley, the royal Governor whom its former leaders had deposed,
to govern Virginia again. No royal banners were unfurled;
Charles II was not proclaimed King. The House of Burgesses,
holding the supreme power in the colony, merely offered the
governorship to the man who had been universally admired
for his justice, humanity, and willingness to sacrifice his own
interest to that of the colony.</p>

<p>Berkeley had been unwilling to disavow his loyalty to the
Crown in 1652 and he was not prepared to do so now. He replied
to the Burgesses' invitation by saying that he would not dare to
offend the King by accepting a commission to govern from any
power in England opposed to him. He urged them to choose
instead a more vigorous man from amongst their own number.
But he did offer to accept the governorship directly from the
House of Burgesses if the Council would concur with the Burgesses
in offering it to him. He promised that if thereafter any
supreme power in England succeeded in re-establishing its authority
in Virginia he would immediately lay down his commission
and "will live most submissively obedient to any power God
shall set over me, as the experience of eight yeares have shewed
I have done." He would not refuse their call, he wrote, if they
accepted his conditions, for "I should be worthily thought hospitall
mad, if I would not change povertie for wealth,&mdash;contempt
for honor."</p>

<p>The Council on March 21, 1660, unanimously concurred in
the Burgesses' choice of Berkeley as Governor, and the King's
loyal servant was thereupon installed in the office.</p>

<p>Some historians have seen the election of Berkeley as the
signal for a royalist purge of the Parliamentary influences that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
were thought to have existed in the colony since 1652. A study
of the membership of the House of Burgesses, Council, and
county courts, however, shows a continuity of membership which
extends from before the Parliamentary seizure of the colony until
after the restoration of King Charles II. The evidence suggests
that there was no violent division between royalists and Parliamentarians
in Virginia. The people were Virginians first and
royalists or Parliamentarians second. The solidarity of their
political interests was a harbinger of the American independence
that was slowly to mature in the next century.</p>

<p>On May 29, 1660, the birthday of Charles II, that monarch
returned to London and was restored to the throne of England.
Word of the restoration was received in Virginia in the fall, and
Berkeley ordered the sheriffs and chief officers of all counties to
proclaim Charles II King of England, and to cause all writs and
warrants from that time on to issue in His Majesty's name. The
Assembly of March 1661, taking into consideration the fact that
the colony, by submitting to the "execrable power" of the Parliamentary
forces, had thereby become guilty of the crimes of that
power, enacted that January 30, the day Charles I was beheaded,
should "be annually solemnized with fasting and prayers that our
sorrowes may expiate our crime and our teares wash away our
guilt." Another act declared May 29, the day of Charles II's
birth and restoration, a holy day to be annually celebrated "in
testimony of our thankfulnesse and joy."</p>

<p>Thus ended the brief period in which Virginia's government
was turned upside down and permanent alteration caused in
her relations with England. Although the King once more became
the symbol of the unity of the colony and the mother country,
the royal prerogative would never again be blindly accepted by
the people of either place. Larger developments in the economic,
social, and intellectual spheres were bringing to an end the era
of all-powerful Kings. Power had descended to the lower ranks
of society, and that power was beginning to be brought into play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>This larger shift of power has been chronicled in the story of
Virginia from 1625 to 1660. It is the story of a small community
of Englishmen transplanted to American shores, living for a
time subject to traditional English restraints, then, in a period of
rapid expansion, losing their cohesiveness and their values under
the impact of the American experience and their own natures.
Their political expression soon passed from a passive to an active
mode. The law became something they made, not something
someone else applied to them. Land was similarly not something
bestowed on them by generous parents, but something one took
from Nature, or Nature's surrogate, the Indian. Labor was no
longer a privilege allowed the individual by the community, but
a precious gift contributed by the individual to the community.
In sum, the ordinary people who had removed themselves to the
New World soon discovered that they were no longer humble
servants of great lords, but were themselves lords of the American
earth. If they had the power why not exercise it? The process
by which the rulers of the people were forced to become the
"servants" of their "subjects" thereupon began. The culmination
of this rearrangement of the political atoms of society was the
War for Independence of 1776. Whether the swing from authority
to liberty was for good or for evil is not for the historian to
say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>Another booklet in this series contains a selected bibliography of works
on seventeenth-century Virginia. The interested student should consult
that booklet for a more detailed listing of works used in preparing this
account of Virginia in the period 1625-1660.</p>

<p>The best secondary account of Virginia in the period covered by this
booklet is Wesley Frank Craven, <i>The Southern Colonies in the Seventeenth
Century, 1607-1689</i> (Baton Rouge, 1949). Craven skilfully combines
research in Virginia local history with a broad understanding of
developments in England and in other colonies. He points out the social
and political significance of many hitherto ignored aspects of Virginia
history. Other important works include Charles McLean Andrews, <i>The
Colonial Period of American History</i>, I (New Haven, 1934), Thomas
Jefferson Wertenbaker, <i>Virginia under the Stuarts</i> (Princeton, 1914),
Herbert L. Osgood, <i>The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century</i>,
3 vols. (New York, 1904-1907), and Edward D. Neill, <i>Virginia Carolorum:
The Colony under the Rule of Charles the First and Second, A.D.
1625-A.D. 1685</i> (Albany, 1886).</p>

<p>Any study of colonial Virginia must begin with a perusal of Philip
Alexander Bruce, <i>Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century</i>,
2 vols. (New York, 1895), and his <i>Institutional History of Virginia
in the Seventeenth Century</i>, 2 vols. (New York, 1910). Bruce's work is
the indispensable platform upon which political and social accounts of
the period must rest. Morgan PoitÃ®aux Robinson, <i>Virginia Counties: Those
Resulting from Virginia Legislation</i> [Virginia State Library, Bulletin, IX,
Nos. 1-3] (Richmond, 1916), is a carefully documented study of the
growth of Virginia as evidenced by the formation of its counties. Maps
showing the area of settlement at frequent intervals give a graphic account
of the nature and extent of Virginia's expansion.</p>

<p>There are a number of local histories chronicling the growth of particular
regions in Virginia. An outstanding local history is Fairfax
Harrison, <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William</i> (Richmond, 1924), which
analyzes the growth of settlement in the Potomac River valley. Histories
of the Eastern Shore are numerous: Susie M. Ames, <i>Studies of the
Virginia Eastern Shore in the Seventeenth Century</i> (Richmond, 1940),
Jennings Cropper Wise, <i>Ye Kingdome of Accawmacke, or the Eastern
Shore of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century</i> (Richmond, 1911), and
Ralph T. Whitelaw, <i>Virginia's Eastern Shore</i>, 2 vols. (Richmond, 1951).</p>

<p>A reading of but a few works in Virginia history will be enough to
show that the interpretations and conclusions of the authors must be
accepted with extreme caution. There are two conflicting interpretations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for nearly every important event in Virginia's history. History may be
defined as the attempt to state what happened in the past on the basis
of inadequate evidence existing in the present. The reader should keep
always in mind that historical writing is largely a series of guesses more
or less intelligently elaborated.</p>

<p>Much of the original manuscript material upon which an account of
the period must be based has been published in the following sources:
William Waller Hening, <i>The Statutes at Large; being a Collection of
all the Laws of Virginia</i>, Vol. I (Richmond, 1809), H. R. McIlwaine,
<i>Minutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia, 1622-1632,
1670-1676</i> (Richmond, 1924), H. R. McIlwaine, <i>Journals of the
House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1619-1658/59</i> (Richmond, 1914), Nell
Marion Nugent, <i>Cavaliers and Pioneers: Abstracts of Virginia Land Patents
and Grants, 1623-1666</i> (Richmond, 1934), <i>Virginia Magazine of
History and Biography</i> (Richmond, 1893 to present), <i>William and Mary
Quarterly</i> (Williamsburg, 1892 to present), <i>The Southern Literary
Messenger</i>, January 1845 (documents on the recall of Governor Berkeley
by the Burgesses and Council of Virginia in 1660), and W. Noel Sainsbury,
<i>Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, 1574-1660, Preserved
in the State Paper Department of Her Majesty's Public Record Office</i>
(London, 1860). The essential guide to most of this material is Earl G.
Swern, <i>Virginia Historical Index</i>, 2 vols. (Roanoke, 1934).</p>

<p>The most important unpublished manuscript materials of the period
are the county records, some of which are complete from the earliest
period of settlement. Originals or transcripts of the county records are
available in the Virginia State Library, Richmond. Another important
source of unpublished manuscript material for the period is the "Virginia,
Book No. 43" manuscript in the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.,
which contains numerous commissions and proclamations for the period
1626-1634. Among the Virginia papers of the Barons of Sackville, Knole
Park, are a few documents relating to the period which have not been
printed either in the documentary articles in the <i>American Historical
Review</i>, XXVII (1922), Nos. 3-4, or elsewhere. They are now available
on microfilm in the Library of Congress, having been photographed by
the British Manuscripts Project of the American Council of Learned
Societies.</p>

<p>Important unpublished dissertations include James Kimbrough Owen,
"The Virginia Vestry: A Study in the Decline of a Ruling Class" (Ph. D.
dissertation, Princeton University, 1947), and Edna Jensen, "Sir John
Harvey: Governor of Virginia" (M. A. thesis, University of Virginia,
1950).</p>
